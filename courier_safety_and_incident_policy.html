<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 10, 2026</p>
<p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 10, 2026</p>

<p>This Courier Safety and Incident Policy (“Safety Policy”) establishes safety expectations and procedures applicable to all Couriers using the Pikkit Platform.</p>

<p>Couriers are solely responsible for their personal safety and for conducting deliveries in a lawful, prudent, and safe manner. Couriers shall comply with all applicable traffic laws, safety regulations, and local ordinances at all times while performing deliveries.</p>

<p>Couriers shall not operate a vehicle while impaired by alcohol, drugs, fatigue, or any condition that could compromise safety. Couriers shall not use handheld devices while driving except as permitted by law.</p>

<p>Couriers must immediately discontinue a delivery if continuing would pose a risk to personal safety, public safety, or property. Couriers may cancel deliveries for safety reasons without penalty where permitted by Platform policy.</p>

<p>In the event of an accident, injury, theft, property damage, or other safety-related incident occurring during a delivery, Couriers must prioritize personal safety and emergency response. Couriers shall contact emergency services where appropriate before notifying the Platform.</p>

<p>Couriers must report safety incidents to the Platform as soon as reasonably practicable and no later than twenty-four (24) hours after the incident, providing truthful and complete information and cooperating with any investigation.</p>

<p>The Platform reserves the right to suspend or restrict Courier access pending investigation of safety incidents. Repeated safety violations, reckless conduct, or failure to report incidents may result in permanent termination.</p>

<p>Nothing in this Safety Policy creates any duty on the part of the Platform to monitor Couriers or to ensure safety beyond facilitating reporting and response mechanisms.</p>
