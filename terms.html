<h1 class="w3-center" style="font-weight: bold;">Pikkit- Terms of Service & User Agreement</h1><br>

<p>Effective Date: January 10, 2026.</p>
<p>Last Updated: January 10, 2026.</p>

<h1 class="w3-center" style="font-weight: bold;">PART I - GENERAL TERMS</h1>
<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">1. Introduction & Definitions</span>
<p>These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the website, mobile applications, and any services provided through the Platform operated by Pikkit (“Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). By accessing or using the Platform, you agree that you have read, understood, and accepted these Terms in full. If you do not agree with any part of these Terms, you must not use the Platform.
</p>

<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>This section sets the legal foundation for the entire agreement. It clarifies that using the Platform constitutes your acceptance of all rules and protections contained herein. By agreeing, Users acknowledge that the Company is providing a technology platform and not performing deliveries directly, which limits the Company’s liability for third-party actions. This clause is critical because it establishes consent and enforceability, ensuring Users understand their obligations before interacting with the Platform.</p>

<p>Definitions:</p>
<p>Platform – Refers to all websites, mobile applications, APIs, and services provided by the Company. This includes updates, upgrades, and supplementary services.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>Clearly defining “Platform” ensures that all references in the Terms are interpreted consistently. For example, if a legal dispute arises regarding an app feature, this definition confirms that the Terms cover both the web and mobile applications.</p>

<p>User – Any person or entity using the Platform, including Senders and Couriers.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>This clarifies that both people requesting deliveries (Senders), Receivers and people performing deliveries (Couriers) are subject to the Terms. This distinction is critical for enforcing rules and assigning responsibility appropriately.</p>

<p>Sender – A User requesting the delivery of items through the Platform.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>Defining Senders separately allows the Terms to assign specific responsibilities, such as accurate item description and legal compliance, which differ from Courier obligations.</p>

<p>Courier – A User performing deliveries as an independent contractor.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>Identifying Couriers as independent contractors is legally important. It ensures they are not employees, which affects labor laws, insurance responsibilities, and tax obligations.</p>

<p>Delivery Request – A shipment or transportation request submitted by a Sender, including item description, pickup and delivery locations, and timing.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>This definition establishes the scope of the service provided and clarifies what constitutes an official request on the Platform. This helps determine liability if an item is lost or damaged.</p>

<p>Prohibited Items – Goods that are illegal, unsafe, or forbidden by Platform rules.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>This ensures Users know what they cannot ship. For example, firearms, explosives, or stolen property fall under this category, and attempting to deliver them can result in account termination and legal action.</p>

<p>Force Majeure Event – Any circumstance beyond the Company’s reasonable control, including natural disasters, pandemics, government orders, or other unforeseeable events that disrupt the Platform.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>This clause protects the Company from liability when delivery failures occur due to extraordinary events. For instance, if a hurricane prevents a Courier from completing deliveries, the Company cannot be held responsible.</p>

<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">2. Eligibility</span>
<p>To use the Platform, Users must meet the following requirements:</p>

<p>Age Requirement: Users must be at least 18 years old.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>Legal contracts entered by minors may be voidable, which could expose the Company to liability. By enforcing a minimum age, the Platform ensures all Users can legally agree to these Terms.</p>

<p>Legal Capacity: Users must have the legal capacity to enter into binding contracts in their jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>This protects the Company from claims that a contract is invalid due to incapacity. For example, individuals under guardianship may not legally enter agreements, so this clause excludes them.</p>

<p>Jurisdictional Restrictions: Platform services are available only in jurisdictions where they are legally authorized.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>This ensures compliance with state and federal regulations regarding transportation, courier services, and digital commerce. Users outside these areas cannot access the service, limiting liability.</p>

<p>Law Compliance: Users must comply with all applicable US federal, state, and local laws.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>This sets the expectation that all Platform activity must be lawful. Violating laws—such as shipping prohibited items—can lead to account termination and legal action.</p>

<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">3. User Accounts and Security</span>
<p>Account Creation: Users must provide accurate, complete, and current information when creating an account.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>Accurate information is crucial for deliveries, billing, insurance, and legal compliance. If a Sender provides a wrong address, or a Courier provides an invalid license, liability issues can arise. This clause allows the Company to require updates or verification.</p>

<p>Account Security: Users are responsible for maintaining confidentiality of login credentials, including passwords and authentication codes.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>Protecting account credentials prevents unauthorized access that could lead to fraudulent deliveries, financial loss, or misuse of the Platform. Users are accountable for any activity under their accounts.</p>

<p>Account Activity Responsibility: Users are liable for all activity conducted under their accounts.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>This ensures that if a third party uses your account, you remain responsible for consequences such as illegal shipments, harassment, or fee evasion, unless you notify the Company promptly.</p>

<p>Notification of Unauthorized Access: Users must immediately inform the Company if they suspect unauthorized account use.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>Prompt reporting allows the Company to freeze accounts, investigate misuse, and mitigate financial or legal harm.</p>

<p>Suspension or Termination: The Company may suspend or terminate accounts for violations, security concerns, or suspicious activity.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>This gives the Company flexibility to maintain Platform integrity and enforce compliance. For example, accounts involved in repeated prohibited item shipments can be terminated to protect other Users and reduce liability.</p>

<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">4. Platform Overview</span>
<p>The Platform is a technology-based service connecting Senders and Couriers. The Company does not provide delivery services directly but facilitates communication, payments, and tracking.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>Clarifying this distinction protects the Company from direct liability for lost or damaged items. For instance, if a Courier mishandles a package, the Platform is not automatically responsible because it only acts as a facilitator.</p>

<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">5. User Conduct</span>
<p>All Users must behave responsibly and lawfully while using the Platform. Specifically, Users must not:</p>
<p>Illegal Activities: Engage in illegal, fraudulent, or unauthorized activities, including transporting prohibited or hazardous goods.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>Preventing illegal activity protects both the Company and its Users from criminal and civil liability. For example, sending stolen electronics through the Platform could involve law enforcement and financial consequences for both Sender and Courier.</p>

<p>Harassment or Threats: Threaten, harass, or abuse other Users, Couriers, or Company personnel. This includes verbal, written, or digital communications.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>Harassment includes threats, intimidation, bullying, or abusive language. This protects the safety and well-being of all Users. For instance, if a Courier threatens a Sender over a dispute, the Platform can suspend or terminate the Courier and provide legal remedies.</p>

<p>False Information: Provide false, misleading, or inaccurate information during account registration, delivery requests, or communications.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>False information could result in lost or misdelivered items, insurance disputes, or safety issues. Accurate information ensures accountability and proper handling of deliveries.</p>

<p>Fee or Security Circumvention: Attempt to bypass Platform fees, security protocols, or monitoring systems.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>Circumventing fees or security exposes the Platform to financial loss and legal risk. For example, arranging cash payments outside the Platform could bypass insurance coverage or tax reporting.</p>

<p>Platform Interference: Disrupt, disable, or harm the Platform, including through malware, hacking, or excessive automated requests.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>Interference could cause downtime, lost deliveries, or compromised data. Users who interfere with the Platform could face suspension, legal action, or liability for damages.</p>

<h1 class="w3-center" style="font-weight: bold;">PART II - SENDER-SPECIFIC TERMS</h1>
<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">6. Delivery Requests</span>
<p>Senders may submit requests for the delivery of items through the Platform. Each request must include accurate information regarding the pickup location, delivery location, item description, weight, size, and any special handling instructions.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>This clause ensures that Couriers can safely and efficiently transport items. For example, if a Sender fails to disclose that a package contains fragile glass items, the Courier may not handle it properly, increasing the risk of breakage. Accurate information also supports insurance claims, proper route planning, and avoids liability disputes.</p>

<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">7. Sender Rights and Responsibilities</span>
<p>Rights:</p>
<p>Select Couriers: Senders may choose from available Couriers based on ratings, reviews, or availability.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>This allows Senders to make informed decisions, encouraging safe and reliable deliveries. For example, a highly rated Courier is more likely to handle valuable items carefully.</p>

<p>Track Deliveries: Senders may track their packages in real-time using the Platform.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>Tracking provides transparency and reassurance. It also allows Senders to report delays promptly, supporting dispute resolution.</p>

<p>Request Refunds or Adjustments: Senders may submit claims for reimbursement if a delivery is lost, delayed, or damaged, in accordance with Platform policies.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>Refunds or adjustments ensure fairness and accountability. For example, if an insured package is lost despite proper handling, a refund or replacement may be warranted.</p>

<p>Responsibilities:</p>
<p>Ensure Legal Compliance: Senders must ensure items are legal to ship.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>Shipping prohibited items exposes both the Sender and the Platform to legal liability. For instance, sending firearms without proper authorization is illegal under federal law.</p>

<p>Proper Packaging: Senders must package items securely and provide accurate descriptions.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>Adequate packaging reduces risk of damage. For example, fragile electronics shipped in a padded box are less likely to break than in a paper bag.</p>

<p>Payment of Fees and Taxes: Senders are responsible for all delivery fees and applicable taxes.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>This ensures the Platform can operate sustainably and comply with tax regulations. Failure to pay fees could result in account suspension.</p>

<p>Cooperation During Investigations: Senders must cooperate with the Platform and Couriers during disputes, investigations, or insurance claims.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>Cooperation supports fair resolution of disputes. For instance, providing photos or receipts helps verify claims of lost or damaged items.</p>

<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">8. Sender Liabilities</span>
<p>Senders are responsible for:</p>
<p>Illegal or Prohibited Items: Shipping items forbidden by law or Platform rules.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>Violating this rule could result in criminal liability. For example, shipping narcotics or hazardous chemicals without authorization may lead to legal prosecution.</p>

<p>Incorrect or Misleading Information: Providing wrong addresses, weights, or descriptions.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>Inaccurate information may lead to lost or delayed deliveries. For instance, sending a 50-pound package labeled as 5 pounds could result in rejected deliveries or Courier refusal.</p>

<p>Violation of Laws: Failing to comply with federal, state, or local regulations.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>This includes tax, transportation, and safety regulations. Non-compliance could result in fines or account termination.</p>

<p>Dispute and Damage Costs: Covering costs arising from disputes, claims, or damages caused by their shipment.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>For example, if a Sender ships hazardous material without disclosure and it damages a Courier’s vehicle, the Sender may be liable for repair or legal claims.</p>

<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">9. Payment, Fees, and Taxes</span>
<p>All fees are displayed before delivery confirmation.</p>
<p>Payments are processed securely through third-party payment providers.</p>
<p>Fees are generally non-refundable unless the Platform’s policies allow exceptions.</p>
<p>Senders are responsible for any applicable sales, use, or other taxes.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>This clarifies the financial obligations of Senders. Using third-party processors ensures secure transactions and reduces fraud. Explicit tax responsibility prevents legal exposure for both the Company and the User.</p>

<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">10. Cancellations and Refunds</span>
<p>Senders may cancel requests before pickup, though fees may still apply.</p>
<p>Refunds for lost, damaged, or delayed items are determined on a case-by-case basis following Platform policies.</p>
<p>Senders should submit claims promptly with supporting documentation.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>This clause balances fairness with operational feasibility. For example, if a Courier is already en route, cancellation fees may apply to compensate for their time. Clear rules prevent disputes over refunds and protect the Platform from financial loss.</p>

<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">11. Insurance & Risk for Senders</span>
<p>Optional insurance may be purchased to cover lost or damaged items.</p>
<p>The Platform is not responsible for items not insured.</p>
<p>Insurance coverage and claims processes are clearly outlined in the Platform’s policies.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>Insurance protects both Senders and Couriers by providing a mechanism for compensation. For example, if a $1,000 electronic device is shipped without insurance and lost, the Platform has no obligation to reimburse the Sender. Optional insurance shifts financial risk appropriately.</p>

<h1 class="w3-center" style="font-weight: bold;">PART III – COURIER-SPECIFIC TERMS</h1>
<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">12. Courier Rights and Responsibilities</span>
<p>Rights:</p>
<p>Accept or Decline Deliveries: Couriers may choose which requests to accept.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>Independent contractors are not forced to take every delivery, protecting their autonomy and safety. For example, a Courier can decline a delivery of hazardous chemicals if not equipped.</p>

<p>Receive Payment: Couriers are entitled to payment for completed deliveries as outlined in the Platform.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>Clear payment terms prevent disputes. For instance, payments may be processed weekly, with deductions for service fees clearly explained.</p>

<p>Support and Dispute Resolution: Couriers can contact the Platform for assistance with delivery issues or claims.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>Access to support ensures fair handling of problems such as lost packages or Sender disputes.</p>

<p>Responsibilities:</p>
<p>Compliance with Laws: Couriers must follow traffic, safety, and transportation laws.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>Non-compliance may lead to legal liability. For example, speeding while making deliveries could result in fines or accidents, for which the Courier is responsible.</p>

<p>Valid Licenses and Insurance: Couriers must maintain appropriate driver’s licenses and vehicle insurance.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>Protects both Courier and Platform in the event of accidents or damages. For instance, delivering with expired insurance could leave the Courier personally liable.</p>

<p>Platform Policies Adherence: Couriers must follow instructions and rules outlined in the Platform, including handling of prohibited items.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>This ensures consistency, safety, and legal compliance. For example, refusing to transport hazardous materials protects the Courier and the Company.</p>

<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">13. Courier Liabilities</span>
<p>Couriers are liable for:</p>
<p>Negligent Damage: Any damage caused by careless handling of items.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>For example, dropping a package of fragile electronics without proper precautions could result in reimbursement obligations.</p>

<p>Prohibited Items: Transporting illegal or unsafe goods.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>Couriers could face criminal and civil penalties if they knowingly transport restricted items, even if instructed by a Sender.</p>

<p>Law Violations: Any infractions while performing deliveries.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>Examples include traffic violations, unlicensed transport, or unsafe handling of hazardous materials.</p>

<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">14. Insurance Requirements</span>
<p>Couriers should maintain vehicle liability insurance and may optionally purchase cargo insurance.</p>
<p>Proof of insurance may be required before continuing to deliver.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>Insurance mitigates risk to Couriers and Platform. For instance, if a Courier causes an accident, insurance covers damages instead of exposing the Platform or Sender to liability.</p>

<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">15. Background Checks & Safety Requirements</span>
<p>Criminal, driving, and identity verification checks may be conducted.</p>
<p>Couriers failing background checks may be suspended or removed.</p>
<p>Couriers must follow safety guidelines, including protective handling and vehicle maintenance.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>Ensures trust and safety. For example, a Courier with a history of theft is a risk for Senders, so checks protect Users and the Platform from criminal exposure.</p>

<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">16. Payment, Taxes, and Reporting</span>
<p>Payments are processed through third-party systems.</p>
<p>Couriers are independent contractors responsible for all taxes.</p>
<p>Tax documents are provided as legally required.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>Independent contractor status clarifies tax obligations and protects the Company from employment-related liability.</p>

<h1 class="w3-center" style="font-weight: bold;">PART IV – PLATFORM PROTECTIONS</h1>
<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">17. Prohibited Items</span>

<p>Users may not request or perform deliveries involving items that are illegal, unsafe, or restricted, including but not limited to:</p>
<p>Drugs and controlled substances</p>
<p>Firearms, explosives, or ammunition</p>
<p>Hazardous chemicals or materials</p>
<p>Stolen, counterfeit, or pirated goods</p>
<p>Perishable items requiring specialized transport</p>
<p>Items prohibited under local, state, or federal law</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>This protects the Platform, Senders, and Couriers from legal and financial exposure. For example, shipping illegal narcotics could result in criminal prosecution. The clause also ensures Couriers are not forced to transport dangerous or illegal goods, which reduces risk of injury, fines, or lawsuits. Prohibited items are strictly monitored, and violations can result in account suspension, termination, or legal action.</p>

<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">18. Delivery Disputes</span>
<p>All disputes between Senders and Couriers are reported to the Platform.</p>
<p>The Platform may mediate to resolve disputes regarding payment, delivery status, or item condition.</p>
<p>Users must cooperate with investigations and provide documentation as requested.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>This ensures fairness and accountability. For instance, if a Courier claims a package was delivered intact but the Sender reports damage, supporting evidence like photos or delivery logs will be required. This clause protects the Platform from liability while enabling a structured resolution process.</p>

<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">19. Arbitration & Legal Disputes</span>
<p>Users agree to resolve disputes through binding arbitration instead of court, unless prohibited by law.</p>
<p>Arbitration covers claims related to services, payments, damages, or any violation of Terms.</p>
<p>Venue, rules, and costs are specified in the Platform’s arbitration policy.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>Arbitration reduces the time, cost, and uncertainty of traditional litigation. For example, if a Sender claims $500 for a lost item, arbitration provides a streamlined process for both parties. This clause also limits class-action lawsuits, protecting the Platform from large-scale claims.</p>

<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">20. Limitation of Liability</span>
<p>The Platform is not responsible for:</p>
<p>Lost, stolen, or damaged items</p>
<p>Delays caused by Couriers, weather, traffic, or force majeure events</p>
<p>Acts or omissions of Users</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>This clause protects the Company from being liable for incidents outside its control. For example, if a hurricane delays deliveries, the Platform cannot be held financially responsible. Clear limitations of liability are essential for legal protection and business sustainability.</p>

<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">21. Indemnification</span>
<p>Users agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Platform, its employees, affiliates, and agents from claims, damages, or losses arising from:</p>
<p>Illegal or prohibited activity</p>
<p>Breach of Terms</p>
<p>Negligence or misconduct</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>Indemnification shifts responsibility to the party causing harm. For example, if a Sender ships hazardous chemicals that cause damage, the Sender would cover legal or financial consequences rather than the Platform. This protects the Company from costly lawsuits and claims.</p>

<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">22. Data Privacy</span>
<p>User data is collected, stored, and processed according to the Platform’s Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Personal information may be used for payments, communications, verification, and legal compliance.</p>
<p>Data may be shared with third parties only as necessary for operations or required by law.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>Protecting privacy builds trust and ensures legal compliance (e.g., with state privacy laws like CCPA). For example, sharing personal info only with Couriers or payment processors prevents misuse while enabling deliveries. Violating privacy rules could result in fines or reputational damage.</p>

<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">23. Force Majeure</span>
<p>The Platform is not liable for failures caused by events beyond its reasonable control, including:</p>
<p>Natural disasters, floods, earthquakes, or pandemics</p>
<p>Government restrictions or orders</p>
<p>Acts of war, terrorism, or civil unrest</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>Force majeure protects the Platform from being held responsible for events outside human control. For example, if a snowstorm prevents deliveries for several days, the Platform is legally protected from claims for missed or delayed shipments.</p>

<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">24. Security Measures</span>
<p>The Platform implements technical, administrative, and physical safeguards to protect Users and data.</p>
<p>Users must also take precautions, such as using strong passwords and reporting unauthorized access.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>This ensures a secure environment and reduces risks of hacking, fraud, or identity theft. For example, a compromised Courier account could be used to ship prohibited items; security requirements reduce this risk.</p>

<h1 class="w3-center" style="font-weight: bold;">PART V – MISCELLANEOUS</h1>
<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">25. Termination</span>
<p>The Platform may suspend or terminate accounts for:</p>
<p>Violations of Terms</p>
<p>Illegal activity</p>
<p>Repeated unsafe behavior</p>
<p>Termination does not affect accrued rights, such as payment or claims.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>Termination protects the Platform and other Users from unsafe or unlawful activity. For example, a Courier repeatedly transporting illegal items can be permanently removed, reducing exposure to liability. Accrued rights ensure fairness, such as receiving payment for completed deliveries.</p>

<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">26. Governing Law</span>
<p>These Terms are governed by and construed under the laws of the United States and the state in which the Platform is headquartered.</p>
<p>Users submit to jurisdiction in that state for legal matters not subject to arbitration.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>Governing law and jurisdiction clarify which legal framework applies. For example, if a dispute arises in a different state, it will still be handled according to the Platform’s home state law, creating consistency and predictability.</p>

<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">27. Modifications</span>
<p>The Platform may update these Terms at any time.</p>
<p>Users are notified of material changes and continued use constitutes acceptance.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>Dynamic services require flexible rules. For instance, if new regulations arise regarding delivery of hazardous materials, the Platform can update Terms to maintain compliance. Advance notice ensures Users are aware of changes.</p>

<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">28. Severability</span>
<p>If any provision is invalid or unenforceable, the remaining Terms remain in effect.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>This ensures that one invalid clause does not nullify the entire agreement. For example, if a specific arbitration provision is struck down by a court, other protections and obligations remain enforceable.</p>

<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">29. Entire Agreement</span>
<p>These Terms, along with Privacy Policy, Insurance Policy, and any supplementary documents, constitute the full agreement between Users and the Platform.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>This clause prevents Users from claiming verbal promises or other documents override the Terms. It ensures all rights, obligations, and protections are clearly documented and enforceable.</p>

<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">30. Contact Information</span>
<p>Users may contact the Platform for questions, complaints, or claims through official support channels provided on the Platform.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>Providing contact information ensures accountability and support. For example, a Sender can report a lost item, or a Courier can dispute a payment issue. Clear communication channels reduce misunderstandings and legal disputes.</p>
