<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 10, 2026</p>
<p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 10, 2026</p>

<p>This Courier Termination and Appeals Process (“Appeals Policy”) governs the suspension and termination of Courier access to the Platform and any applicable appeal procedures.</p>

<p>The Platform may suspend or terminate a Courier’s access at any time, with or without notice, for reasons including but not limited to violations of the Agreement, safety concerns, suspected fraud, misuse of the Platform, failure to maintain required insurance, or legal compliance requirements.</p>

<p>Termination decisions are made at the Platform’s sole discretion based on available information, reports, and investigations.</p>

<p>Where permitted by law, Couriers may submit an appeal of a termination decision within fourteen (14) calendar days of receiving notice of termination. Appeals must be submitted through designated Platform channels and must include all relevant information and supporting documentation.</p>

<p>The Platform will review appeals in good faith but does not guarantee reinstatement. Decisions on appeal are final and binding.</p>

<p>Nothing in this Appeals Policy limits the Platform’s right to immediately terminate access where necessary to protect users, comply with legal obligations, or address safety or fraud risks.</p>

<p>Termination of access does not affect accrued rights or obligations, including outstanding payments for completed deliveries, indemnification obligations, or dispute resolution provisions.</p>
