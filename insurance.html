<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 10, 2026</p>
<p><strong>Governing Law:</strong> State of California</p>

<hr>

<h2 class="w3-center">PART I – PURPOSE, SCOPE, AND LEGAL STATUS</h2>

<p>
This Insurance Policy (“Policy”) sets forth the terms under which limited insurance coverage may be made available in connection with delivery requests facilitated through the Pykkit Platform (“Platform”). This Policy is intended to describe, in summary form, certain insurance-related features associated with the Platform and does not itself constitute an insurance contract.
</p>

<p>
Insurance coverage, if any, is provided solely pursuant to insurance policies issued by licensed third-party insurance carriers (“Insurers”). Pykkit does not act as an insurer, underwriter, or guarantor of coverage and makes no representations beyond those expressly stated herein. In the event of any inconsistency between this Policy and the terms of an Insurer’s policy, the Insurer’s policy shall govern in all respects.
</p>

<p>
This Policy is incorporated by reference into the Pykkit Terms of Service and forms part of the binding agreement between Users and the Platform.
</p>

<hr>

<h2 class="w3-center">PART II – DEFINITIONS</h2>

<p>
For purposes of this Policy, the following definitions apply. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned in the Terms of Service.
</p>

<p>
<strong>“Covered Property”</strong> means tangible personal property lawfully tendered for delivery through the Platform, excluding all Prohibited Items and Excluded Property as defined herein.
</p>

<p>
<strong>“Courier”</strong> means an independent contractor who accepts and performs a delivery request through the Platform.
</p>

<p>
<strong>“Sender”</strong> means a User who submits a delivery request through the Platform.
</p>

<p>
<strong>“Care, Custody, or Control”</strong> means the period commencing upon physical pickup of Covered Property by a Courier and terminating upon confirmed delivery to the designated recipient.
</p>

<p>
<strong>“Covered Cause of Loss”</strong> means direct physical loss of or damage to Covered Property occurring during the Care, Custody, or Control of a Courier, subject to all exclusions, limitations, and conditions set forth herein and in the applicable Insurer policy.
</p>

<hr>

<h2 class="w3-center">PART III – COVERAGE GRANT</h2>

<p>
Subject to strict compliance with this Policy and the applicable Insurer policy, limited insurance coverage may be made available for direct physical loss of or damage to Covered Property caused by a Covered Cause of Loss while such Covered Property is in the Care, Custody, or Control of a Courier during an active delivery request.
</p>

<p>
Coverage, if applicable, is secondary to any other valid and collectible insurance available to a Sender or Courier and applies only to the extent expressly permitted by the Insurer.
</p>

<p>
No coverage shall exist unless all eligibility requirements, reporting obligations, and conditions precedent are satisfied.
</p>

<hr>

<h2 class="w3-center">PART IV – EXCLUSIONS</h2>

<p>
This Policy does not apply to, and no coverage shall be afforded for, loss, damage, or liability arising out of or in connection with any of the following, whether directly or indirectly:
</p>

<p>
• Illegal, prohibited, or contraband items <br> 
• Firearms, ammunition, explosives, or weapons of any kind <br>
• Drugs, controlled substances, or pharmaceuticals <br>
• Currency, cash, coins, bullion, negotiable instruments, or securities <br>
• Jewelry, watches, precious metals, gemstones, or fine art <br>
• Perishable goods requiring temperature-controlled transport <br>
• Hazardous materials or chemicals <br>
• Stolen, counterfeit, or fraudulently obtained property <br>
• Loss caused by delay, seizure, confiscation, or governmental action <br>
• Ordinary wear and tear, inherent vice, or improper packaging <br>
• Loss occurring outside the Care, Custody, or Control period <br>
</p>

<p>
These exclusions apply regardless of whether a Courier or Sender was aware of the nature of the property.
</p>

<hr>

<h2 class="w3-center">PART V – CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO COVERAGE</h2>

<p>
As a strict condition precedent to any potential coverage, the Sender must:
</p>

<p>
• Provide complete and accurate delivery information <br>
• Ensure lawful shipment and proper packaging <br>
• Report any loss or damage within seventy-two (72) hours of discovery <br>
• Submit all requested documentation, including photographs and receipts <br>
• Cooperate fully with any investigation conducted by the Platform or Insurer <br>
</p>

<p>
Failure to satisfy any condition precedent shall void coverage in its entirety.
</p>

<hr>

<h2 class="w3-center">PART VI – CLAIMS PROCESS</h2>

<p>
Claims must be submitted exclusively through the Platform in accordance with published procedures. Submission of a claim does not guarantee approval or payment.
</p>

<p>
All claims are subject to investigation, verification, and determination by the Insurer. The Insurer reserves the right to deny any claim that does not strictly comply with policy terms.
</p>

<p>
Payment, if approved, shall not exceed the actual cash value of the Covered Property at the time of loss, less any applicable deductible.
</p>

<hr>

<h2 class="w3-center">PART VII – NO COURIER-PURCHASED CARGO INSURANCE</h2>

<p>
At this time, Couriers are not permitted to purchase cargo or shipment insurance through the Platform. Couriers are solely responsible for maintaining any personal insurance coverage required by law, including vehicle liability insurance.
</p>

<p>
Nothing in this Policy creates any obligation for the Platform to provide insurance coverage to Couriers.
</p>

<hr>

<h2 class="w3-center">PART VIII – SUBROGATION</h2>

<p>
To the extent permitted by law, any Insurer providing coverage shall be subrogated to all rights of recovery against any party responsible for the loss, including Couriers or third parties.
</p>

<p>
Users agree to execute any documents necessary to secure such rights.
</p>

<hr>

<h2 class="w3-center">PART IX – LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h2>

<p>
In no event shall the Platform be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including loss of profits or business interruption.
</p>

<p>
The maximum liability of the Platform, if any, shall not exceed the amount actually paid by an Insurer under an applicable policy.
</p>

<hr>

<h2 class="w3-center">PART X – GOVERNING LAW & INTERPRETATION</h2>

<p>
This Policy shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to conflict-of-laws principles.
</p>

<p>
Headings are for convenience only and shall not affect interpretation.
</p>

<hr>

<h2 class="w3-center">PART XI – ENTIRE POLICY</h2>

<p>
This Policy, together with the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, constitutes the entire understanding regarding insurance matters between Users and the Platform.
</p>

<p>
No oral statements or representations shall modify this Policy.
