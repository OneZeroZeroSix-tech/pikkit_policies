<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 10, 2026</p>
<p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 10, 2026</p>

<p>This Proposition 22 Earnings Guarantee Addendum (“Addendum”) is incorporated into and forms part of the Pykkit Courier Independent Contractor Agreement (“Agreement”) and applies solely to Couriers performing delivery services within the State of California.</p>

<p>This Addendum is intended to comply with California Business and Professions Code section 7451 et seq. (Proposition 22). In the event of any conflict between this Addendum and the Agreement, this Addendum shall control solely with respect to matters governed by Proposition 22.</p>

<p>For purposes of this Addendum, “Engaged Time” means the period of time during which a Courier is actively engaged in performing a delivery request, commencing upon acceptance of a delivery request through the Platform and terminating upon completion or cancellation of the delivery request. Engaged Time does not include time spent logged into the Platform but not actively performing a delivery.</p>

<p>Pykkit shall ensure that, for each earnings period, Couriers receive guaranteed minimum compensation equal to at least one hundred twenty percent (120%) of the applicable California minimum wage for all Engaged Time, plus compensation for engaged mileage as required by law, subject to offsets permitted under Proposition 22.</p>

<p>Guaranteed earnings calculations shall be performed on a periodic basis as determined by the Platform. If a Courier’s total compensation for Engaged Time during the applicable period falls below the minimum required by Proposition 22, the Platform shall provide a supplemental payment to satisfy the statutory minimum.</p>

<p>Nothing in this Addendum shall be construed to create an employment relationship or to guarantee any minimum number of delivery requests, hours, or earnings beyond those expressly required by law.</p>

<p>Couriers remain free to accept or decline delivery requests and to determine their own schedules. The Platform does not guarantee availability of delivery requests or income.</p>

<p>Couriers acknowledge that earnings calculations are based solely on Engaged Time and that time spent waiting, traveling without an active delivery, or remaining logged into the Platform without an accepted request is not compensable under Proposition 22.</p>
