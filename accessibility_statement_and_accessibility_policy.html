<hr>
<h2 class="w3-center">1. PURPOSE AND INTENT</h2>
<p>This Accessibility Statement and Accessibility Policy (“Policy”) sets forth the Platform’s formal commitment to digital accessibility and equal access for individuals with disabilities. The Platform recognizes the importance of providing a website, mobile applications, and digital services that are usable by all individuals, including those with visual, auditory, motor, cognitive, or other disabilities.</p>
<p>This Policy is adopted to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Reduce risk of claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and analogous state laws</p></li>
<li><p>Demonstrate good-faith efforts toward accessibility compliance</p></li>
<li><p>Align Platform operations with recognized accessibility standards, including WCAG</p></li>
<li><p>Provide a documented process for accessibility feedback, remediation, and ongoing improvement</p></li>
<li><p>Support legal, insurance, and regulatory review</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This Policy applies to all public-facing and user-facing digital properties operated or controlled by the Platform.</p>

<hr>
<h2 class="w3-center">2. LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND REGULATORY CONTEXT</h2>
<p>The Platform acknowledges that digital accessibility obligations may arise under multiple legal regimes, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), Titles II and III</p></li>
<li><p>Section 504 and Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (where applicable)</p></li>
<li><p>California Unruh Civil Rights Act</p></li>
<li><p>California Disabled Persons Act</p></li>
<li><p>Comparable state and local disability access laws</p></li>
</ul>
<p>While regulations specific to websites and mobile applications continue to evolve, courts and enforcement agencies frequently reference WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) as the primary benchmark for determining accessibility compliance. This Policy is intended to align with that evolving legal landscape.</p>

<hr>
<h2 class="w3-center">3. ACCESSIBILITY STANDARDS ADOPTED</h2>
<p>The Platform’s accessibility goal is to conform, where reasonably practicable, to:</p>
<p>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1, Level AA, as published by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), and any subsequent updates or successor standards.</p>
<p>WCAG principles include ensuring content is:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Perceivable</p></li>
<li><p>Operable</p></li>
<li><p>Understandable</p></li>
<li><p>Robust</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The Platform recognizes that full compliance may not be immediately achievable in all areas due to technical, operational, or legacy constraints, but commits to continuous improvement.</p>

<hr>
<h2 class="w3-center">4. SCOPE OF COVERAGE</h2>
<p>This Policy applies to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Platform’s website(s)</p></li>
<li><p>Mobile applications</p></li>
<li><p>User dashboards and portals</p></li>
<li><p>In-app messaging systems</p></li>
<li><p>Forms, checkout flows, and account management tools</p></li>
<li><p>Customer support and help center interfaces</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Third-party content, integrations, or services linked to or embedded within the Platform may not be fully accessible; however, the Platform will make reasonable efforts to encourage accessibility among vendors and service providers.</p>

<hr>
<h2 class="w3-center">5. ACCESSIBILITY FEATURES AND PRACTICES</h2>
<p>The Platform endeavors to incorporate accessibility best practices, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Semantic HTML structure (headings, lists, landmarks)</p></li>
<li><p>Text alternatives for non-text content where feasible</p></li>
<li><p>Sufficient color contrast</p></li>
<li><p>Keyboard navigability</p></li>
<li><p>Logical focus order</p></li>
<li><p>Readable and predictable navigation</p></li>
<li><p>Avoidance of flashing or seizure-triggering elements</p></li>
<li><p>Resizable text and responsive layouts</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Accessibility is considered during design, development, testing, and deployment phases, subject to resource and technical constraints.</p>

<hr>
<h2 class="w3-center">6. KNOWN LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS</h2>
<p>Despite best efforts, some accessibility barriers may exist due to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Legacy code or third-party software limitations</p></li>
<li><p>Rapid platform updates or feature rollouts</p></li>
<li><p>User-generated content beyond Platform control</p></li>
<li><p>Browser, device, or assistive technology compatibility issues</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The Platform does not represent that its digital properties are entirely free of accessibility defects at all times. This Policy reflects an ongoing commitment, not a guarantee of absolute compliance.</p>

<hr>
<h2 class="w3-center">7. ACCESSIBILITY FEEDBACK AND ASSISTANCE</h2>
<p>The Platform provides a dedicated mechanism for users to report accessibility barriers or request assistance.</p>
<p>Users who encounter accessibility issues are encouraged to contact the Platform using the following information:</p>
<p>Accessibility Contact Method:</p>

<hr>
<h2 class="w3-center">8. RESPONSE AND REMEDIATION PROCESS</h2>
<p>Upon receipt of an accessibility request or complaint, the Platform will:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Log the request internally</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct a preliminary assessment of the reported issue</p></li>

<li><p>Prioritize fixes based on severity, impact, and resources</p></li>
<li><p>Communicate status updates where appropriate</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Temporary alternative access methods may be offered where immediate remediation is not possible.</p>

<hr>
<h2 class="w3-center">9. INTERNAL RESPONSIBILITY AND GOVERNANCE</h2>
<p>Accessibility responsibility is shared across multiple functions, including:</p>

<li><p>Mapping and navigation</p></li>
<li><p>Analytics</p></li>
<li><p>Customer support tools</p></li>
</ul>
<p>While the Platform encourages accessibility compliance among vendors, it does not control third-party accessibility and cannot guarantee their compliance. Issues related to third-party services may be escalated to the vendor where feasible.</p>

<hr>
<h2 class="w3-center">12. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h2>
<p>Nothing in this Policy:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Creates contractual rights beyond existing agreements</p></li>
<li><p>Constitutes an admission of non-compliance</p></li>
<li><p>Waives defenses available under applicable law</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The Platform’s accessibility efforts are undertaken in good faith and subject to reasonable limitations.</p>

<hr>
